## Functionality

* The user can see the current day displayed at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
* The user is presented with timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
* The timeblocks are Color-coded based on past, present, and future events when the timeblock is viewed.
* The user can enter an event when they click a timeblock and save the entered event.
